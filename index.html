                    <p> &emsp;My name is Ian Cogswell. I grew up in Massachusetts and moved to New Hampshire shortly after High-School.
                        After High-School I got into gaming (who didn't) and got to go "pro" for a Summer. I eventually found
                        friends who shared similar passions in art and websites. I had previously built websites in MSPaint
                        when I was a wee lad so I choose to follow my passions. My passion has always been in art and design
                        and I have continued that passion into coding. For awhile I created my own company, Aroarian Studios,
                        and was successful for a year. I got a few customers but my passions shifted and my focus went to
                        a more stable career. I found myself working for Liberty Mutual and became a Business Systems Analyst
                        which lead me back to my passions.
                    </p>
                    <p> &emsp;My coding experience has grown over the years picking up tid bits of information here or there
                        or learning the basics of a new language. I have had the pleasure to work in Java, Javascript, HTML,
                        CSS, SQL, VisualBasic and Selenium and I can't wait to learn more!
